"""Arguments and Return objects for tasks."""

# Place holder for Task IO
# Arguments are very similar to DAG outputs

# Returns are very similar to Function outputs
# Follow those examples to populate them

# Argument is either from a DAGInput, another TaskOutput or a item input.
# The value can also be fixed. These values should be mapped to Function inputs.
# In that sense these inputs just make the connection between the two.
